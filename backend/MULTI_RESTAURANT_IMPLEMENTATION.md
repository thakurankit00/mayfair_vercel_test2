## Backend Implementation

### 1. New Models Created

#### `Restaurant.js`

- Methods for staff management (`assignStaff`, `removeStaff`, `hasUserAccess`)
- Statistical methods (`getStatistics`)
- Query methods (`getActive`, `getByType`, `getWithKitchens`)

#### `OrderKitchenLog.js`
- Model for tracking all kitchen interactions
- Methods for logging actions and retrieving activity

#### `MenuCategory.js`, `MenuItem.js`, `RestaurantTable.js`
- Updated models with restaurant relationships
- Restaurant-specific query methods

#### `Order.js`
- Enhanced with kitchen routing functionality
- Methods for kitchen assignment, acceptance, rejection, transfer
- Kitchen-specific querying

### 2. Enhanced Controllers

#### `restaurantController.js`
- Added `getRestaurants()` endpoint
- Updated all table management to be restaurant-specific
- Updated menu management for multi-restaurant support
- Backward compatibility with legacy endpoints

#### `orderController.js`
- Enhanced `createOrder()` with automatic kitchen routing
- Added kitchen management endpoints:
  - `getKitchenOrders()` - Get orders for specific kitchen
  - `acceptKitchenOrder()` - Chef accepts order
  - `rejectKitchenOrder()` - Chef rejects order with reason
  - `transferOrderToKitchen()` - Transfer order between kitchens
  - `getOrderKitchenLogs()` - Get kitchen interaction history

#### `kitchenController.js` (New)

- `getKitchenDashboard()` - Kitchen-specific dashboard data
- `assignStaffToKitchen()` - Assign staff to kitchens
- `removeStaffFromKitchen()` - Remove staff assignments
- `getKitchenStaff()` - List kitchen staff

### 3. Updated Routes

#### Multi-Restaurant Routes
```
GET /api/v1/restaurant/restaurants - Get all restaurants
GET /api/v1/restaurant/restaurants/:restaurantId/tables - Restaurant-specific tables
GET /api/v1/restaurant/restaurants/:restaurantId/menu - Restaurant-specific menu
POST /api/v1/restaurant/restaurants/:restaurantId/tables - Create restaurant table
```

#### Kitchen Management Routes
```
GET /api/v1/restaurant/kitchens - Get all kitchens
GET /api/v1/restaurant/kitchens/:kitchenId/dashboard - Kitchen dashboard
GET /api/v1/restaurant/kitchens/:kitchenId/staff - Kitchen staff
POST /api/v1/restaurant/kitchens/:kitchenId/staff - Assign staff
GET /api/v1/restaurant/kitchen/:kitchenId/orders - Kitchen orders
POST /api/v1/restaurant/kitchen/:kitchenId/orders/:orderId/accept - Accept order
POST /api/v1/restaurant/kitchen/:kitchenId/orders/:orderId/reject - Reject order
POST /api/v1/restaurant/orders/:orderId/transfer - Transfer to different kitchen
GET /api/v1/restaurant/orders/:orderId/kitchen-logs - Order kitchen logs
```

## Kitchen Workflow Implementation

### 1. Order Placement
- When placing an order, system automatically determines target kitchen:
  - Bar orders → Bar Kitchen  
  - Restaurant orders → Main Kitchen
  - Can be manually overridden by specifying `target_kitchen_id`

### 2. Kitchen Assignment
- Orders are automatically assigned to appropriate kitchen
- Kitchen assignment is logged in `order_kitchen_logs`
- Kitchen staff can view pending orders for their kitchen

### 3. Chef/Bartender Actions
- **Accept Order**: Chef accepts order, can provide estimated time and notes
- **Reject Order**: Chef rejects order with mandatory reason
- All actions are logged with timestamp and staff member

### 4. Order Transfer
- Waiters can transfer orders between kitchens if assigned to wrong kitchen
- Includes reason for transfer
- Resets kitchen status to 'pending' in new kitchen

### 5. Role-Based Access
- **Chefs**: Can accept/reject orders in restaurant kitchens
- **Bartenders**: Can accept/reject orders in bar kitchens  
- **Waiters**: Can place orders and transfer between kitchens
- **Managers/Admins**: Full access to all operations

## Data Population

### 1. Default Restaurants Created
- **Mayfair Restaurant** (restaurant type, ground floor, Main Kitchen)
- **Sky Roof Bar** (bar type, sky roof, Bar Kitchen)

### 2. Staff Assignments
- Created population script that assigns:
  - Managers to all restaurants
  - Chefs to restaurant kitchens
  - Bartenders to bar kitchens  
  - Waiters to both restaurants (cross-trained)

### 3. Existing Data Migration
- All existing tables assigned to appropriate restaurants
- All existing menu categories assigned to restaurants
- Existing orders updated with restaurant and kitchen assignments

## API Testing Results

Successfully tested all major endpoints:

✅ **GET /restaurants** - Lists both restaurants with full details
✅ **GET /kitchens** - Lists available kitchens  
✅ **GET /kitchens/:id/staff** - Shows properly assigned staff
✅ **GET /restaurants/:id/tables** - Restaurant-specific tables
✅ **Authentication & Authorization** - Role-based access working

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Robust Kitchen Routing**
- Automatic kitchen assignment based on order type
- Manual kitchen selection by waiters
- Kitchen transfer capability with audit trail

### 2. **Chef-Waiter Interaction**
- Chefs can accept orders with estimated preparation time
- Chefs can reject orders and send back to waiters with reason
- Full audit trail of all kitchen interactions

### 3. **Multi-Restaurant Support**
- Separate menus and tables per restaurant
- Restaurant-specific staff assignments  
- Cross-restaurant staff capabilities (waiters can work both)

### 4. **Scalability**
- Architecture supports adding more restaurants easily
- Role-based permissions system
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Legacy API endpoints still work
- Existing frontend code continues to function
- Gradual migration path available

## Next Steps (Frontend Implementation)

The remaining tasks involve frontend implementation:

1. **Restaurant Selection UI** - Allow users to choose restaurant
2. **Kitchen Dashboard** - Chef interface for managing orders
3. **Waiter Interface Updates** - Kitchen selection and transfer options
4. **Enhanced Order Tracking** - Show kitchen status and logs

The backend is fully functional and ready to support the complete multi-restaurant workflow with separate kitchens, chef-waiter interaction, and robust order management.
