# Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Restaurant Page Errors ✅
**Problem**: Restaurant page was throwing errors because the API functions were not properly integrated.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `restaurantApi.js` to use its own axios instance with proper interceptors
- Updated the main `api.js` to import and use the actual restaurant API functions instead of placeholder functions
- Restaurant API now works correctly with all endpoints (tables, menu, reservations, orders)

### 2. Room Edit and View Details Not Working ✅
**Problem**: "Edit" and "View Details" buttons in room management were not functional.

**Solution**:
- Added proper API methods for room type management (`createRoomType`, `updateRoomType`, `deleteRoomType`, `bulkUpdatePrices`)
- Implemented modal components for editing and viewing room type details
- Added handler functions to load room type data and save changes
- Fixed field name inconsistencies (database uses both `max_occupancy` and `capacity`)

### 3. Database Population ✅
**Problem**: No test data available for restaurant and room functionalities.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive restaurant data population script with 12 tables, 9 menu categories, and 20 menu items
- Created room types population script with 5 different room types
- Both scripts clear existing data and populate fresh test data

## New Features Added

- **Menu Management**: Full menu system with categories and items, restaurant vs bar classification
